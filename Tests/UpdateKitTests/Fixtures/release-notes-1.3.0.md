### Added
- you can now run sol's on-screen analysis entirely on your own Apple Silicon Mac. choose the on-device option in settings, and the part of sol that makes sense of what's on your screen runs locally, with nothing about those frames going to a cloud provider. it's opt-in, vision-only for now, and needs a Mac with at least 16 GB of memory. a one-time model download happens the first time you turn it on.
- the menu bar now tells you when your journal needs attention and opens settings for restart or setup.
- you can now power sol with your Anthropic or OpenAI account without installing anything separately. enable the provider in settings and paste your key, and solstone installs what it needs on its own.

### Changed
- the timeline view is rebuilt. it fits any window width, shows where each entry came from with a link to that day, and refreshes in place as new days roll up.
- long todo lists load faster. solstone now shows a focused first screen with a "show more" control, instead of rendering the entire list up front.
- pairing a phone is more reliable, and the paused state in the menu now reads "paused - 8 min left" so you can see at a glance when sol resumes.

### Fixed
- videos and audio in your journal that wouldn't play now play correctly, with a clearer message on the rare file that still can't.
- when transcription hit a dense stretch of speech it could fail outright; it now recovers on its own, and segments that did fail are surfaced instead of disappearing silently.
- pages occasionally got stuck loading on a cold start, and the paused and error menu-bar icons had lost their sun in 1.2.1. both are resolved, alongside internal stability improvements.
