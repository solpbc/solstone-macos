## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.36 (build 74)] - 2026-10-07

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.36](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.36) →

### Fixed
- the journal app no longer keeps two processor cores busy while your journal runs.
- before moving the journal app to Trash, the removal command in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/solpbc/solstone-journal/blob/v2.0.36/INSTALL.md#uninstall-on-mac) now stops it from starting at login.

## [2.0.35 (build 73)] - 2026-10-07

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.35](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.35) →

### Fixed
- quitting the journal app while "add a device" or a "remove" question is open now quits it. before, the journal app stayed open, and logging out or restarting your mac could be refused.

## [2.0.34 (build 72)] - 2026-10-06

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.34](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.34) →

## [2.0.33 (build 71)] - 2026-10-05

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.33](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.33) →

### Fixed
- opening the journal app while your journal starts now waits for its mark. home and device pairing show "your · journal" while it loads, then show your mark when it can be read.

## [2.0.32 (build 70)] - 2026-10-04

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.32](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.32) →
- your journal is named by its mark. there is no name to edit. home shows the mark, and if the journal app can't read it, it shows "mark · unavailable".

## [2.0.31 (build 69)] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.31](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.31) →

## [2.0.30 (build 68)] - 2026-10-03

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.30](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.30) →
- run state settings now show the journal's version and build, and the system it runs on, in one block with a copy button, so you can paste it when you ask for help.
- home and the updates item in the sidebar now show when a journal update needs attention. install actions explain that the journal is unavailable while the journal app restarts.
- updates settings explain when automatic checks are off and let you turn them on.

### Fixed
- the release notes link now opens the journal app's notes. after an update check finished, the check button could stay unavailable. it now comes back right away, and checking again updates the "last checked" time even when the result is the same.

## [2.0.29 (build 67)] - 2026-10-02

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.29](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.29) →

### Fixed
- with VoiceOver on, the journal app no longer reads out hidden labels meant for automated testing between the real controls.
- when your journal stops unexpectedly several times within a minute, or not all of its processes can be confirmed closed, the home and run state pages now say so, above the start button.

## [2.0.28 (build 66)] - 2026-10-01

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.28](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.28) →

## [2.0.27 (build 64)] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.27](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.27) →

## [2.0.27 (build 62)] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.26](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.26) →

## [2.0.26 (build 61)] - 2026-09-28

### Added
- the journal menu now has "open admin terminal". it opens a Terminal window in your own shell. in zsh (the mac default), bash or fish, `journal` and `solstone` there run this app's own copies. nothing is installed, and your shell files stay as they were.

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.24](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.24) →

### Fixed
- running the journal app's own program from a terminal with a command, such as `journal --version`, now runs that command and returns. before, it opened the app instead and the terminal never got an answer.
- the "automatic updates" checkboxes and the "how often" menu in "updates" now show your change as soon as you make it. before, the boxes kept showing the old setting even though your change was saved, and each further click changed the setting again. if you clicked either box, check how each one is set now.

## [2.0.25 (build 60)] - 2026-09-27

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.23](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.23) →


## [2.0.24 (build 59)] - 2026-09-27

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.22](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.22) →

## [2.0.23 (build 58)] - 2026-09-26

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.19](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.19) →

## [2.0.22 (build 56)] - 2026-09-25

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.18](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.18) →

## [2.0.21 (build 55)] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.17](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.17) →

### Fixed
- while you set up your journal, the time-of-day background now fills the whole window. it used to stop short of the edges, leaving a plain band down each side.

## [2.0.20 (build 54)] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.16](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.16) →
- the time-of-day background in the journal app's window now follows your mac's light or dark setting, and no longer switches the window between light and dark on its own. after sunset, a warm glow stays in the corner where the sun went down, and it's gone only for a few hours around the middle of the night, then comes back in the corner where the sun will rise.

## [2.0.19 (build 53)] - 2026-09-23

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.15](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.15) →

### Fixed
- removing a device from your journal in settings no longer reports a failure after the device was removed. the list now refreshes right away.


## [2.0.16 (build 50)] - 2026-09-22

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.13](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.13) →

### Fixed
- the background that follows the time of day is now accurate for a day that crosses midnight in your time zone, a sunset after midnight, and the multi-day case near the poles.


## [2.0.15 (build 49)] - 2026-09-21

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.12](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.12) →


## [2.0.14 (build 48)] - 2026-09-20

### Added
- the journal app's window now shifts its background with the time of day, taking sunrise and sunset from your mac's time zone rather than your location. the window goes light and dark with it, instead of following your mac's appearance setting. there's no setting for it yet.

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.11](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.11) →


## [2.0.13 (build 47)] - 2026-09-19

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.10](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.10) →


## [2.0.12 (build 46)] - 2026-09-18

### Changed
- home now leads with "open your journal" and says where it opens: in your browser. the journal app keeps your journal running on your mac.
- the pane where you name your journal and see where it lives is now called "name & location".
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.9](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.9) →

### Fixed
- before your journal has a mark of its own, this app's home pane now shows the placeholder mark instead of empty space.

## [2.0.10 (build 44)] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.8](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.8) →

## [2.0.9 (build 43)] - 2026-09-15

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.7](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.7) →

## [2.0.8 (build 42)] - 2026-09-14

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.5](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.5) →

## [2.0.7 (build 41)] - 2026-09-13

### changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.4](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.4).

## [2.0.6 (build 40)] - 2026-09-12

### Changed
- nothing changed in the journal app itself. this release keeps its version in step with the solstone app, which shipped its own changes the same day and carries its own notes.

## [2.0.5 (build 39)] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed
- the journal app now checks its bundled models and repairs anything missing before it starts your journal. if something that depends on them stopped working after an update, this resolves it.
- quitting the journal app while first-time setup is running now stops setup, instead of letting it continue after you have quit.

## [2.0.4 (build 38)] - 2026-09-12

### Changed
- nothing changed in the journal app itself. this release keeps its version in step with the solstone app, which shipped its own changes the same day and carries its own notes.

## [2.0.3 (build 37)] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- nothing changed in the journal app itself. this release keeps its version in step with the solstone app, which shipped its own changes the same day and carries its own notes.

## [2.0.2 (build 36)] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- fixed a timing calculation that could misreport how long it had been since intake last reached your journal, especially around time zone changes.

## [2.0.1 (build 35)] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- nothing in the journal app changed in this build.

## [2.0.1 (build 34)] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- nothing in the journal app changed in this build.

## [2.0.1 (build 33)] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed
- fresh setup no longer says the installation couldn't be verified when another copy of the journal command is already installed.

## [2.0.1 (build 32)] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- nothing in the journal app changed in this build.

## [2.0.1 (build 31)] - 2026-09-11

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.1](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.1) →
- confirmed journal marks now use neutral colors in setup and settings.

## [2.0.0 (build 30)] - 2026-09-09

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [2.0.0](https://solstone.app/releases#v2.0.0) →
- device renaming has been removed from the devices list. pairing and removing devices work as before.

### Fixed
- when the solstone app installs a newer copy of the journal app, it now waits for the open copy to quit before replacing it. if installation cannot finish, the copy you already have stays intact.
- some upgrades from the older background setup could stop partway if its background process was not running. the journal app can now finish the handoff.
- if the journal app stopped unexpectedly, it could fail to start again because part of the old attempt was still running. the journal app now clears that old process before restarting.
- when you quit the journal app, it now stays closed instead of reopening on its own.

## [1.0.22 (build 24)] - 2026-08-01

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.22](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.22) →


## [1.0.21 (build 23)] - 2026-08-01

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.21](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.21) →

### Fixed
- two devices with the same name could look identical in the devices list, so it was easy to remove the wrong one. each device now shows when it last connected and when you paired it, and the remove confirmation names the device you picked.
- renaming a device now starts from that device's own name, so a rename saves just the name you typed.


## [1.0.20 (build 22)] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.20](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.20) →


## [1.0.19 (build 21)] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.19](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.19) →


## [1.0.18 (build 20)] - 2026-07-28

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.18](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.18) →

### Fixed
- some of the tools the journal sets up alongside itself could point at a temporary folder that no longer existed once setup finished, so they would not launch. they are now written to run from where they actually live.


## [1.0.17 (build 19)] - 2026-07-26

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.17](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.17) →

### Fixed
- setting up a brand new journal now finishes instead of waiting at the last step.
- the journal app no longer ends up without a working journal after it updates its bundled copy.


## [1.0.13 (build 15)] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.13](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.13) →

## [1.0.12 (build 14)] - 2026-07-22

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal to [1.0.12](https://solstone.app/releases#v1.0.12) →


## [1.0.11] - 2026-07-22

### Changed

- updated the bundled journal to [0.9.1](https://solstone.app/releases#v0.9.1) →

## [1.0.10] - 2026-07-19

### Changed

- updated the bundled journal to [0.9.0](https://solstone.app/releases#v0.9.0) →


## [1.0.9] - 2026-07-17

### Changed

- when the journal app finds a background journal service, it now shuts that service down and removes it, but only once it can prove the service is running the same journal the app was set up for. if the service points at a different journal, or the journal app can't tell, it stops and tells you what it found instead of taking over: nothing is uninstalled, stopped, or started while that's unclear. running a journal from the command line, with no journal app, works as it did before.
- updated the bundled journal runtime to 0.8.9.

### Fixed

- once the journal app adopts your journal, it's the only thing running it. before, a background journal service could be running that same journal at the same time, and the two competed for the same files and the same port, so your journal could look healthy while behaving oddly. if you ran into that, this resolves it.
- the journal app now calls your journal ready only when the journal it started is the one answering. before, it trusted whatever answered on the port, which could be a different copy entirely.
- if you have your own `sol` or `journal` command, setup no longer replaces it with its own version. your command keeps working across app updates: the journal app refreshes only the commands it created, and leaves anything else exactly as it found it.

## [1.0.8] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- first run can now adopt an existing journal that sol found on this mac: the location arrives pre-filled, and setup accepts the existing journal in place.

### Changed

- updated the bundled journal runtime to 0.8.8.

## [1.0.7] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- updated the bundled journal runtime to 0.8.7.

## [1.0.6] - 2026-07-14

### Changed
- updated the bundled journal runtime to 0.8.6.


## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-12

### Changed
- the bundled journal runtime now installs solstone 0.8.4, which adds batch review of duplicate-merge suggestions, renders sol's chat replies with formatting, checks your journal by default when you ask about your own history, shows live progress while local thinking installs, keeps your transcript text out of internal error reports, and handles local thinking and transcription limits more honestly.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- the bundled journal runtime now installs solstone 0.8.3.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-07

### Changed
- the bundled journal runtime now installs solstone 0.8.2, which keeps the screen and combined-transcript tabs from going blank on unexpected content, makes local thinking on your own machine steadier, files calendar moments as their own category, and stops the home page repeating the same thing to do twice.

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-07

### Changed
- the bundled journal runtime now installs solstone 0.8.1, including exact-match journal search, the unified journal app frame, local media/social/ambient-sound hints, and local helper-model checks in settings.

### Fixed
- `sol call health summary` now works from a sol-only runtime install without importing journal-only readiness code.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- (describe new journal-visible additions)

### Changed
- (describe journal behavior changes)

### Fixed
- (describe journal bug fixes)


## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- the journal has its own app now. your journal — the memory sol keeps — is a visible, deliberately installed thing: a dock app with a native window for its name, its mark, and its run state.
- creating a journal is a short ritual: name it, choose where it lives, then meet your journal's mark — lock it in, and the app's own icon becomes it.
- the devices pane shows every device that keeps to this journal, opens a pairing window for a new one, and can rename or revoke.
- the journal app updates itself, separately from sol.

### Changed
- if sol was keeping your journal on this mac, the journal app adopts it in place — same journal, nothing moves.
